Package releasing made easy: zest.releaser overview and installation
====================================================================

zest.releaser is collection of command-line programs to help you automate the
task of releasing a Python project.

It does away with all the boring bits. This is what zest.releaser automates
for you:

* It updates the version number. The version number can either be in
  ``setup.py`` or ``version.txt`` (or in a ``__versions__`` attribute in a
  Python file). For example, it switches you from ``0.3.dev0`` (current
  development version) to ``0.3`` (release) to ``0.4.dev0`` (new development
  version).

* It updates the history/changes file. It logs the release date on release and
  adds a new heading for the upcoming changes (new development version).

* It tags the release. It creates a tag in your version control system named
  after the released version number.

* It optionally uploads a source release to PyPI. It will only do this if the
  package is already registered there (else it will ask, defaulting to 'no');
  zest releaser is careful not to publish your private projects!


Most important URLs
-------------------

First the three most important links:

- The full documentation is at `zestreleaser.readthedocs.org
  <http://zestreleaser.readthedocs.org>`_.

- We're `on PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zest.releaser>`_, so we're only
  an ``pip install zest.releaser`` away from installation on your computer.

- The code is at `github.com/zestsoftware/zest.releaser
  <https://github.com/zestsoftware/zest.releaser>`_.

And... we're automatically being tested by Travis:

   :target: https://travis-ci.org/#!/zestsoftware/zest.releaser


Installation
------------

Just a simple ``pip install zest.releaser`` or ``easy_install zest.releaser`` is
enough.

Alternatively, buildout users can install zest.releaser as part of a specific
project's buildout, by having a buildout configuration such as::

    [buildout]
    parts =
        scripts

    [scripts]
    recipe = zc.recipe.egg
    eggs = zest.releaser


Version control systems: svn, hg, git, bzr
------------------------------------------

Of course you must have a version control system installed.  zest.releaser
currently supports:

- Subversion (svn).

- Mercurial (hg).

- Git (git).

- Bazaar (bzr).

Others could be added if there are volunteers! Git and mercurial support
have been contributed years ago when we were working with bzr and subversion,
for instance.


Available commands
------------------

Zest.releaser gives you four commands to help in releasing python
packages.  They must be run in a version controlled checkout.  The commands
are:

- **prerelease**: asks you for a version number (defaults to the current
  version minus a 'dev' or so), updates the setup.py or version.txt and the
  CHANGES/HISTORY/CHANGELOG file (with either .rst/.txt/.markdown or no
  extension) with this new version number and offers to commit those changes
  to subversion (or bzr or hg or git)

- **release**: copies the the trunk or branch of the current checkout and
  creates a version control tag of it.  Makes a checkout of the tag in a
  temporary directory.  Offers to register and upload a source dist
  of this package to PyPI (Python Package Index).  Note: if the package has
  not been registered yet, it will not do that for you.  You must register the
  package manually (``python setup.py register``) so this remains a conscious
  decision.  The main reason is that you want to avoid having to say: "Oops, I
  uploaded our client code to the internet; and this is the initial version
  with the plaintext root passwords."

- **postrelease**: asks you for a version number (gives a sane default), adds
  a development marker to it, updates the setup.py or version.txt and the
  CHANGES/HISTORY/CHANGELOG file with this and offers to commit those changes
  to version control. Note that with git and hg, you'd also be asked to push
  your changes (since 3.27). Otherwise the release and tag only live in your
  local hg/git repository and not on the server.

- **fullrelease**: all of the above in order.

There are two additional tools:

- **longtest**: small tool that renders a setup.py's long description
  and opens it in a web browser. This assumes an installed docutils
  (as it needs ``rst2html.py``).

- **lasttagdiff**: small tool that shows the diff of the currently committed
  trunk with the last released tag.  Handy for checking whether all the
  changes are adequately described in the changes file.
