Changelog for zest.releaser
===========================

3.31 (2012-02-23)
-----------------

- Fixed test for unadvised egg_info commands on tag, which could
  result in a ConfigParser error.
  [maurits]


3.30 (2011-12-27)
-----------------

- Added some more PyPI classifiers.  Tested with Python 2.4, 2,4, 2.6,
  and 2.7.
  [maurits]

- Moved changes of 3.15 and older to docs/HISTORY.txt.
  [maurits]

- Added GPL license text in the package.
  [maurits]

- Updated README.txt.  Added MANIFEST.in.
  [maurits]


3.29 (2011-12-27)
-----------------

- In postrelease create a version number like 1.0.dev0.
  See http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0386
  [maurits]

- Offer to cleanup setup.cfg on the tag when releasing.  You do not
  want tag_build or tag_svn_revision options in a release usually.
  [maurits]

- For convenience also print the tag checkout location when only doing
  a release (instead of a fullrelease).
  [maurits]


3.28 (2011-11-18)
-----------------

- Git: in pre/postrelease only check for uncommitted changes in files
  that are already tracked.
  [maurits]


3.27 (2011-11-12)
-----------------

- Postrelease now offers (=asks) to push your changes to the server if you're
  using hg or git.

- Support for some legacy projects, often converted from CVS, have multiple
  subprojects under a single trunk. The trunk part from the top level project
  isn't erroneously stripped out anymore. Thanks to Marc Sibson for the fix.


3.26 (2011-11-01)
-----------------

- Added sanity check before doing a prerelease so you are warned when
  you are about to commit on a tag instead of a branch (or trunk or
  master).
  [maurits]


3.25 (2011-10-28)
-----------------

- Removed special handling of subversion lower than 1.7 when searching
  for the history/changes file.  In corner cases it may be that we
  find a wrong HISTORY.txt or CHANGES.txt file when you have it buried
  deep in your directory structure.  Please move it to the root then,
  which is the proper place for it.
  [maurits]

- Fixed finding a history/changes file that is in a sub directory when
  using subversion 1.7 or higher or bazaar.
  [maurits]


3.24 (2011-10-19)
-----------------

- Note: you may need to install setuptools_subversion when you use
  subversion 1.7.  If you suddenly start missing files in the sdists
  you upload to PyPI you definitely need it.  Alternatively: set up a
  proper MANIFEST.in as that method works with any version control
  system.
  [maurits]

- Made compatible with subversion 1.7 (the only relevant change is in
  the code that checks if a tags or tag directory already exists).
  Earlier versions of subversion are of course still supported.
  [maurits]

- Code repository moved to github:
  https://github.com/zestsoftware/zest.releaser
  [maurits]


3.23 (2011-09-28)
-----------------

- Fixed opening the html long description in ``longtest`` on Mac OS X
  Lion or python2.7 by using a ``file://`` url.
  Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/zest.releaser/+bug/858011
  [maurits]


3.22 (2011-05-05)
-----------------

- Allow specifying a tag on the command line when using lasttaglog or
  lasttagdiff, to show the log or diff since that tag instead of the
  latest.  Useful when you are on a branch and the last tag was from
  trunk.
  [maurits]


3.21 (2011-04-20)
-----------------

- Added lasttaglog command that list the log since the last tag.
  [maurits]

- Fix Mercurial (hg) support. As spreaded_internal should be set
  to False (as it happens with git)
  [erico_andrei]

- Accept a twiggle (or whatever '~' is called) when searching for
  headers in a changelog; seen in some packages (at least
  zopeskel.dexterity).
  [maurits]


3.20 (2011-01-25)
-----------------

- Also allowing CHANGES.rst and CHANGES.markdown in addition to
  CHANGES.txt.


3.19 (2011-01-24)
-----------------

- No longer refuse to register and upload a package on pypi if it is
  not there yet, forcing people to do this manually the first time.
  Instead, we ask the question and simply have 'No' as the default
  answer.  If you specify an answer, we require exactly typing 'yes'
  or 'no'.  The idea is still to avoid making it too easy to release
  an internal package on pypi by accident.  [maurits]


3.18 (2010-12-08)
-----------------

- Added ``--non-interactive--`` option to the ``svn diff`` command used in
  lasttagdiff.  This makes it usable in cronjobs and post-commit hooks.
  Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/zest.releaser/+bug/687530


3.17 (2010-11-17)
-----------------

- When the package that is being released neither has a setup.py nor a
  setup.cfg, use No as default answer for creating a checkout of the
  tag.
  [maurits]


3.16 (2010-11-15)
-----------------

- For (pypi) output, also show the first few lines instead of only the
  last few.
  [maurits]

- See if pypirc or setup.cfg has a [zest.releaser] section with option
  release = yes/no.  During the release stage, this influences the
  default answer when asked if you want to make a checkout of the tag.
  The default when not set, is 'yes'.  You may want to set this to
  'no' if most of the time you only make releaser of internal packages
  for customers and only need the tag.
  [maurits]

- Specify bazaar (bzr) tag numbers using the 'tag' revision specifier
  (like 'tag:0.1') instead of only the tag number (0.1) to add
  compatibility with earlier bzr versions (tested with 2.0.2).
  [maurits]

For older changes see ``HISTORY.txt`` in the ``docs`` directory.
