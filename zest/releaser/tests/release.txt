Detailed tests of release.py
============================

.. :doctest:
.. :setup: zest.releaser.tests.functional.setup
.. :teardown: zest.releaser.tests.functional.teardown

Some initial imports:

    >>> from zest.releaser import release
    >>> from zest.releaser import utils
    >>> import os
    >>> utils.TESTMODE = True


Check availability on pypi
--------------------------

"Testing" means "don't really poll pypi", so the test setup does some
monkeypatching for us:

    >>> from urllib import request
    >>> request.urlopen
    <function ..._mock_urlopen at ...>

There's a mock list of packages that our mock pypi provides:

    >>> mock_pypi_available
    []

Search a non-existing package:

    >>> release.package_in_pypi('zest.releaser')
    False

Now search for an "existing" package:

    >>> mock_pypi_available.append('zest.releaser')
    >>> release.package_in_pypi('zest.releaser')
    True


Version grabbing
----------------

    >>> os.chdir(gitsourcedir)
    >>> releaser = release.Releaser()

Grab the version:

    >>> releaser._grab_version()
    >>> releaser.data['version']
    '0.1.dev0'

If, by some weird twist of fate, there's no release: we exit.

    >>> releaser.vcs.get_setup_py_version = lambda: None
    >>> releaser._grab_version()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    RuntimeError: SYSTEM EXIT (code=1)


Check tag existence
-------------------

We automatically check if a tag already exists.  First set the version to 0.1:

    >>> releaser = release.Releaser()
    >>> releaser.vcs.version = '0.1'
    >>> releaser.prepare()
    >>> releaser.data['tag_already_exists']
    False

If the tag doesn't exist yet, no safety question is asked:

    >>> releaser._info_if_tag_already_exists()

Mock that the tag exists and we get a question:

    >>> releaser.data['tag_already_exists'] = True
    >>> utils.test_answer_book.set_answers(['n'])
    >>> utils.AUTO_RESPONSE
    False
    >>> releaser._info_if_tag_already_exists()
    Question: There is already a tag 0.1, show if there are differences? (Y/n)?
    Our reply: n
    >>> utils.test_answer_book.set_answers(['y'])
    >>> releaser._info_if_tag_already_exists()
    Question: There is already a tag 0.1, show if there are differences? (Y/n)?
    Our reply: y
    git diff 0.1
    RED fatal: ambiguous argument '0.1': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.
    ...

Note: the diff itself fails as we mocked its existence.


Making tags
-----------

If the tag doesn't exist yet, we can make one.  The actual tag creation is
tested already, here we test that you get a sys.exit if you refuse to run the
tag command:

    >>> releaser = release.Releaser()
    >>> releaser.data['tag_already_exists'] = False
    >>> releaser.data['version'] = '0.1'
    >>> releaser.data['tag'] = '0.1'
    >>> releaser.data['tag-message'] = 'Tagging {version}'
    >>> releaser.data['tag-signing'] = False
    >>> utils.test_answer_book.set_answers(['n'])
    >>> releaser._make_tag()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    RuntimeError: SYSTEM EXIT (code=1)

If the the tag already exists, we just return without doing anything.

    >>> releaser.data['tag_already_exists'] = True
    >>> releaser._make_tag()
