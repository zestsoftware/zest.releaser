Integration test
================

.. :doctest:
.. :setup: zest.releaser.tests.functional.setup
.. :teardown: zest.releaser.tests.functional.teardown

This test is based on the functional tests using a git repository, but enables
releaser hooks on the test package and ensures that they run.

Several items are prepared for us.

A git directory (repository and checkout in one):

    >>> gitsourcedir
    'TESTTEMP/tha.example-git'
    >>> import os
    >>> os.chdir(gitsourcedir)

Asking input on the prompt is not unittestable unless we use the prepared
testing hack in utils.py:

    >>> from zest.releaser import utils
    >>> utils.TESTMODE = True

Append the [zest.releaser] section to the setup.cfg file, enabling the
releaser hooks:

    >>> with open('setup.cfg', 'a') as f:
    ...     _ = f.write("""
    ... [zest.releaser]
    ... hook_package_dir = src
    ... prereleaser.before = tha.example.hooks.prereleaser_before
    ... prereleaser.middle = tha.example.hooks.prereleaser_middle
    ... prereleaser.after = tha.example.hooks.prereleaser_after
    ... releaser.before = tha.example.hooks.releaser_before
    ... releaser.middle = tha.example.hooks.releaser_middle
    ... releaser.after_checkout = tha.example.hooks.releaser_after_checkout
    ... releaser.before_upload = tha.example.hooks.releaser_before_upload
    ... releaser.after = tha.example.hooks.releaser_after
    ... postreleaser.before = tha.example.hooks.postreleaser_before
    ... postreleaser.middle = tha.example.hooks.postreleaser_middle
    ... postreleaser.after = tha.example.hooks.postreleaser_after""")

Commit the change to setup.cfg so that we have a clean checkout:

    >>> from zest.releaser import git
    >>> checkout = git.Git()
    >>> cmd = checkout.cmd_commit("tweak setup.cfg to enable hooks")
    >>> print('dummy %s' % utils.execute_command(cmd))
    dummy...tweak setup.cfg to enable hooks

Run the prerelease script.  Note that pyroma and check-manifest have
hooks here so they are run too, but the order may differ.  With the
bin/test script first pyroma is run, then check-manifest.  With tox it
is the other way around.  So we use ellipsis for that part.

    >>> from zest.releaser import prerelease
    >>> utils.test_answer_book.set_answers(['', '', '', '', ''])
    >>> prerelease.main()
    prereleaser_before
    ...

The release script tags the release and uploads it:

    >>> utils.test_answer_book.set_answers(['y', 'y', 'y', 'y', 'y', 'y', 'y', 'y'])
    >>> mock_pypi_available.append('tha.example')
    >>> from zest.releaser import release
    >>> release.main()
    releaser_before
    releaser_middle

    Tag needed to proceed, you can use the following command:
    git tag 0.1 -m "Tagging 0.1"
    Question: Run this command (Y/n)?
    Our reply: y
    <BLANKLINE>
    Question: Check out the tag
        (for tweaks or pypi/distutils server upload) (Y/n)?
    Our reply: y

And the postrelease script ups the version:

    >>> utils.test_answer_book.set_answers(['', '', 'n'])
    >>> from zest.releaser import postrelease
    >>> postrelease.main()
    postreleaser_before
    Current version is 0.1
