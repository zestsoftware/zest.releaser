Detailed tests of bzr.py
=======================

.. :doctest:
.. :setup: zest.releaser.tests.functional.setup
.. :teardown: zest.releaser.tests.functional.teardown

Some initial imports:

    >>> from zest.releaser import bzr
    >>> from zest.releaser.utils import execute_command
    >>> import os

Project name
------------

The prepared bzr project has a setup.py, so the name in there is used:

    >>> os.chdir(bzrsourcedir)
    >>> checkout = bzr.Bzr()
    >>> checkout.name
    'tha.example'

When the setup.py doesn't exist or doesn't return a proper name, we fall back
to the directory name.

    >>> orig = checkout.get_setup_py_name
    >>> checkout.get_setup_py_name= lambda: None  # Hack
    >>> checkout.name
    'tha.example-bzr'
    >>> checkout.get_setup_py_name = orig  # Restore hack


Diff and commit
---------------

Make a change:

    >>> setup_py = os.path.join(bzrsourcedir, 'setup.py')
    >>> with open(setup_py, 'a') as f:
    ...    _ = f.write('\na = 2\n')
    >>> cmd = checkout.cmd_diff()
    >>> cmd
    ['bzr', 'diff']
    >>> print(execute_command(cmd))
    === modified file 'setup.py'

Commit it:

    >>> cmd = checkout.cmd_commit('small tweak')
    >>> cmd

    >>> print(execute_command(cmd))

Note the red color: bzr prints everything to stderr...


Tags
----

Originally there are no tags (the default 'tip' tag is filtered out):

    >>> checkout.available_tags()
    []

Create a tag and it will show up:

    >>> cmd = checkout.cmd_create_tag('0.1', 'Creating tag 0.1')
    >>> cmd
    ['bzr', 'tag', '0.1']
    >>> dont_care = execute_command(cmd)
    >>> checkout.available_tags()
    ['0.1']

A specific tag url is important for subversion, but nonsensical for
bazaar.  We just return the version as-is:

    >>> checkout.tag_url('holadijee')
    'holadijee'

Make and commit a small change:

    >>> with open(setup_py, 'a') as f:
    ...     _ = f.write('\nb = 3\n')
    >>> cmd = checkout.cmd_commit('small tweak')
    >>> print(execute_command(cmd))
    RED Committing to: TESTTEMP/tha.example-bzr/
    RED modified setup.py
    RED Committed revision 3.

Now we can request the changes since a specific tag:

    >>> cmd = checkout.cmd_diff_last_commit_against_tag('0.1')
    >>> cmd
    ['bzr', 'diff', '-r', 'tag:0.1..-1']
    >>> print(execute_command(cmd))

Making a tag checkout
---------------------

Some bzr versions cannot checkout in an existing directory, so contrary
svn we will not create an empty tempdir before doing a checkout.
The tag checkout command makes a checkout in a fresh dir:

    >>> checkout.checkout_from_tag('0.1')

At the end of the command we are in the created directory.  The
checkout is done directly in that temporary directory, so not in a
newly created subdirectory of it:

    >>> os.getcwd()
    '.../tha.example-0.1-...'
    >>> sorted(os.listdir('.'))
    ['.bzr', '.bzrignore', 'CHANGES.txt', ...]

Pushing changes
---------------

For bzr, committing is normally enough. We assume you've set it up that way,
though you might not have done so. There's no handy way to find out, though.

    >>> checkout.push_commands()
    []
