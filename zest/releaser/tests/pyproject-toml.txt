Integration test
================

Now try a project with only a ``pyproject.toml`` and no ``setup.cfg`` or ``setup.py``.

Several items are prepared for us.

A git directory (repository and checkout in one):

    >>> gitsourcedir
    'TESTTEMP/tha.example-git'
    >>> import os
    >>> os.chdir(gitsourcedir)

We remove and add files.

    >>> from zest.releaser import tests
    >>> from zest.releaser.utils import execute_command
    >>> import shutil
    >>> _ = execute_command(["git", "rm", "setup.cfg", "setup.py"])
    >>> pyproject_file = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(tests.__file__), "pyproject.toml")
    >>> shutil.copy(pyproject_file, os.path.curdir)
    './pyproject.toml'
    >>> _ = execute_command(["git", "add", "pyproject.toml"])
    >>> _ = execute_command(["git", "commit", "-m", "Move to pyproject.toml"])
    >>> print(execute_command(["git", "status"]))
    On branch main
    nothing to commit, working directory clean

The version is at 0.1.dev0:

    >>> githead('pyproject.toml')
    [project]
    name = "tha.example"
    version = "0.1.dev0"
    description = "Example package"
    keywords = ["example"]

Asking input on the prompt is not unittestable unless we use the prepared
testing hack in utils.py:

    >>> from zest.releaser import utils
    >>> utils.TESTMODE = True

Run the prerelease script:

    >>> from zest.releaser import prerelease
    >>> utils.test_answer_book.set_answers(['', '', '', '', ''])
    >>> prerelease.main()
    Question...
    Question: Enter version [0.1]:
    Our reply: <ENTER>
    Checking data dict
    Question: OK to commit this (Y/n)?
    Our reply: <ENTER>

The changelog now has a release date instead of ``(unreleased)``:

    >>> githead('CHANGES.txt')
    Changelog of tha.example
    ========================
    <BLANKLINE>
    0.1 (2008-12-20)
    ----------------

And the version number is just 0.1 and has lost its dev marker:

    >>> githead('pyproject.toml')
    [project]
    name = "tha.example"
    version = "0.1"
    description = "Example package"
    keywords = ["example"]

The release script tags the release and uploads it.  Note that in the
other function tests we call
``mock_pypi_available.append('tha.example')``, but we do not do this
here.  This way we can check what happens when a package is not yet
known on PyPI:

    >>> utils.test_answer_book.set_answers(['y', 'y', 'y', 'yes'])
    >>> from zest.releaser import release
    >>> release.main()
    Checking data dict
    Tag needed to proceed, you can use the following command:
    git tag 0.1 -m 'Tagging 0.1'
    Question: Run this command (Y/n)?
    Our reply: y
    <BLANKLINE>
    Question: Check out the tag
        (for tweaks or pypi/distutils server upload) (Y/n)?
    Our reply: y
    RED Note: ...0.1...
    ...
    Preparing release 0.1
    ...
    running sdist
    ...
    running bdist_wheel
    ...
    Question: Upload to pypi (y/N)?
    Our reply: yes
    MOCK twine dispatch upload ...whl ...example-0.1.tar.gz

(Note: depending in the Python/setuptools version, the filename may contain ``tha.example`` or ``tha_example``.)

There is now a tag:

    >>> print(execute_command(["git", "tag"]))
    0.1

And the postrelease script ups the version:

    >>> utils.test_answer_book.set_answers(['', '', 'n'])
    >>> from zest.releaser import postrelease
    >>> postrelease.main()
    Current version is 0.1
    Question: Enter new development version ('.dev0' will be appended) [0.2]:
    Our reply: <ENTER>
    Checking data dict
    Question: OK to commit this (Y/n)?
    Our reply: <ENTER>
    Question: OK to push commits to the server? (Y/n)?
    Our reply: n

The changelog and pyproject.toml are at 0.2 and indicate dev mode:

    >>> githead('CHANGES.txt')
    Changelog of tha.example
    ========================
    <BLANKLINE>
    0.2 (unreleased)
    ----------------
    >>> githead('pyproject.toml')
    [project]
    name = "tha.example"
    version = "0.2.dev0"
    description = "Example package"
    keywords = ["example"]

And there are no uncommitted changes:

    >>> print(execute_command(["git", "status"]))
    On branch main
    nothing to commit, working directory clean
