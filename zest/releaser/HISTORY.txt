Changelog for zest.releaser
===========================

1.9 (2009-02-24)
----------------

- 'release' now also makes a tag checkout in a temporary directory.
  [Reinout]

- Made 'longtest' work on Linux as there the command is 'rst2html' and
  apparently on the Mac it is 'rst2html.py'.  [maurits]


1.8 (2009-02-23)
----------------

- Added 'longtest' command that renders a setup.py's long description
  and opens it in a web browser.  [reinout]


1.7 (2009-02-16)
----------------

- Supporting alternative history version header format: 'version - date'.
  [reinout]


1.6 (2009-02-14)
----------------

- Patch by Michael Howitz: sys.executable is used instead of a string that
  doesn't work on every system.  [reinout]


1.5 (2009-02-11)
----------------

- Changed y/n into Y/n, so defaulting to 'yes'.  [reinout]

- Improved the documentation.  [reinout]

- When a yes/no question is asked, do not treat 'no' as the default
  but explicitly ask for an input -- it was too easy to press enter
  and wrongly expect 'yes' as default.  [maurits]


1.4 (2008-10-23)
----------------

- Fixed missing import of utils.  [maurits]


1.3 (2008-10-23)
----------------

- Moved stabilize script to zest.stabilizer so that zest.releaser is just for
  releasing individual packages. Nice, tidy, reusable.  [reinout]

- Allowing '-v' option on all commands: it gives you debug-level logging.
  [reinout]


1.2 (2008-10-16)
----------------

- We now prefer the version from setup.py over any version.txt file
  found.  When getting or changing the version we get/change the
  setup.py version when it differs from the found version.txt version.
  [maurits]


1.1 (2008-10-15)
----------------

- Cleaned out zest-specific stuff. Cleaned up 'release'. [reinout]


1.0 (2008-10-15)
----------------

- Stabilize looks up the most recent tag of our development packages and uses
  gp.svndevelop to allow svn checkouts as development eggs. [reinout]

- Do not look for version.txt in directories that are not handled by
  subversion.  Use case: Products.feedfeeder, which has a buildout.cfg
  and so can have a parts directory with lots of version.txt files...
  [maurits]


0.9 (2008-10-02)
----------------

- release: offer to register and upload the egg to the cheese shop.
  After that you still have the option to upload to our own tgz
  server.  [maurits]

- postrelease: for the suggestion of a new version simply try add 1 to
  the last character in the version; the previous logic failed for
  example for '1.0b3'.  [maurits]

- prerelease: ask user to enter next version (give him a suggestion).
  Handy when you want to change '1.0b3 dev' into '1.0'.  [maurits]

- Started 'stabilize'. [reinout]


0.8 (2008-09-26)
----------------

- fullrelease: change back to the original directory after each
  pre/actual/post release step.  [maurits]

- release: switch back to original directory when ready to fix 'commit
  to tag' error.  [maurits]

- prerelease: quit when no version is found.  [maurits]

- Reverted sleeping fix from 0.7 as it did not work.  [maurits]


0.7 (2008-09-26)
----------------

- fullrelease: hopefully fix a 'commit on tag' bug by sleeping three
  seconds before doing the post release.  [maurits]


0.6 (2008-09-26)
----------------

- Added fullrelease script that does a prerelease, actual release and
  post release in one go.  [maurits]


0.5 (2008-09-26)
----------------

- Factored part of prerelease.check_version() out into
  utils.cleanup_version().  We now use that while setting the version
  in the history during postrelease.  [maurits]

- Add newline at the end of the generated version.txt.  [maurits]


0.4 (2008-09-26)
----------------

- Made the logging userfriendly.


0.3 (2008-09-26)
----------------

- Postrelease: Better injection of history. Various other robustness fixes.


0.2 (2008-09-26)
----------------

- postrelease: added suggestion for new version (a plain enter is enough to
  accept it). [reinout]

- prerelease: ask before changing version + solidified regex for heading
  detection. [reinout]

- prerelease: detect non-development versions better and change them.
  [maurits]

- prerelease: made the commit message read: 'Preparing release xxx'.
  [maurits]

- postrelease: made the new version something like '1.0 dev'.
  [maurits]

- postrelease: we now add some lines to the history now.  [maurits]

- prerelease: try changing the version to a non-development version,
  stripping off something like '(...)'.  [maurits]

- release: Refactored so release.py has the 'main' function required
  by setup.py.  [maurits]


0.1 (2008-09-24)
----------------

- Got a basic version of the prerelease script working (version check, history
  file updating, committing). [reinout]

- Started by copying the guidelines script. [reinout]
