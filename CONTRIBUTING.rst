Hi!
===

You're using `zest.releaser <https://zestreleaser.readthedocs.io>`_ and want
to report a bug or problem or you want to fix something yourself? Feel free!
Github is the place to do so.

- Report bugs or problems at
  https://github.com/zestsoftware/zest.releaser/issues

- Or make a fork, fix the bug or add something and open a pull request.

- You can mail us if you want to ask a question, too. Or if you want to tell
  us about an idea you have. Mail both `reinout@vanrees.org
  <mailto:reinout@vanrees.org>`_ and `maurits@vanrees.org
  <mailto:maurits@vanrees.org>`_.

Normally you ought to get a reply from Reinout or Maurits (we're the main
developers) within a few days, but often within a couple of hours. If it takes
longer, feel free to email us as a reminder.


If you want to work on zest.releaser, read the developer info in
``doc/source/developing.rst``.  Or read it online at
https://zestreleaser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing.html .

Note that there's a way to extend zest.releaser without modifying
zest.releaser itself: look at the `entrypoints documentation
<https://zestreleaser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/entrypoints.html>`_ to see if
that can help you. Several people have used that to tweak zest.releaser to fit
in perfectly with their specific needs.
