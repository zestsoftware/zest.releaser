# apt-get update is needed as there's a faulty PPA in use inside travis
# itself, which means we cannot install git-svn. The update fixes it.
  - sudo apt-get install git-svn
# In the line above, really only git-svn is needed as the rest
# is automatically installed. But then again, git-svn used to be
# installed by default, too. So for later reference, you need
# "git bzr mercurial subversion", too.
