Changelog for zest.releaser
===========================

9.0.0a2 (unreleased)
--------------------

- If ``encoding`` is set in the config file, the reading of text doesn't break
  anymore. Fixes `issue 391
  <https://github.com/zestsoftware/zest.releaser/issues/391>`_.


9.0.0a1 (2023-07-13)
--------------------

- Changed build system to pypa/build instead of explicitly using
  setuptools.

- Zest.releaser's settings can now also be placed in ``pyproject.toml``.

- Use native namespace packages for ``zest.releaser``, instead of
  deprecated ``pkg_resources`` based ones.

- Added pre-commit config for neater code (black, flake8, isort).

- Dropped support for python 3.7. Together with switching to ``build`` and
  ``pyproject.toml``, this warrants a major version bump.


8.0.0 (2023-05-05)
------------------

- Make final release, no changes since latest alpha.  [maurits]


8.0.0a2 (2023-04-06)
--------------------

- Always create wheels, except when you explicitly switch this off in the config:
  ``[zest.releaser] create-wheel = no``.
  If the ``wheel`` package is not available, we still do not create wheels.
  Fixes `issue 406 <https://github.com/zestsoftware/zest.releaser/issues/406>`_.
  [maurits]

- Do not fail when tag versions cannot be parsed.
  This can happen in ``lasttaglog``, ``lasttagdiff``, and ``bumpversion``, with ``setuptools`` 66 or higher.
  Fixes `issue 408 <https://github.com/zestsoftware/zest.releaser/issues/408>`_.

8.0.0a1 (2023-02-08)
--------------------

- Drop support for Python 3.6.  [maurits]

- Support reading and writing the version in ``pyproject.toml``.

  `issue 373 <https://github.com/zestsoftware/zest.releaser/issues/373>`_,
  and `PEP-621 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/>`_,
  [maurits]


7.3.0 (2023-02-07)
------------------

- Add option ``run-pre-commit = yes / no``.
  Default: no.

  This may interfere with releasing when they fail.

7.1.0 (2022-11-23)
------------------

- Add the ``bumpversion`` options to the ``postrelease`` command.
  This means ``feature``, ``breaking``, and ``final``.
  [rnc, maurits]

- Add ``--final`` option to ``bumpversion`` command.
  This removes alpha / beta / rc markers from the version.
  [maurits]

- Add support for Python 3.11, remove ``z3c.testsetup`` from test dependencies.  [maurits]


7.0.0 (2022-09-09)
------------------

- Optionally add prefix text to commit messages.  This can be used ensure your messages follow some regular expression.
  To activate this, add ``prefix-message = [TAG]`` to a ``[zest.releaser]``
  section in the ``setup.cfg`` of your package, or your global
  ``~/.pypirc``.  Or add your favorite geeky quotes there.

7.0.0a3 (2022-04-04)
--------------------

- Bug 381: In ``prerelease``, check with ``pep440`` if the version is canonical.
  Added ``pep440`` to the ``recommended`` extra, not to the core dependencies:
  ``zest.releaser`` can also be used for non-Python projects.
  [maurits]


7.0.0a2 (2022-02-10)
--------------------

- Add ``--headless`` option to ``longtest``.


7.0.0a1 (2021-12-01)
--------------------

Big cleanup to ease future development:

- Removed support for Subversion (``svn``), Bazaar (``bzr``), Mercurial (``hg``).

- Removed support for Python 2 and 3.5.

- Added support for Python 3.9 and 3.10.

- Tested with Python 3.6-3.10 plus PyPy3.

- Switched from Travis to GitHub Actions.

- Simplified running commands by using ``subprocess.run``.
